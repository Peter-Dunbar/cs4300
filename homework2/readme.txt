HW2 was created with the aid of AI tools.
I used it to help me step through each part in the HW, and used it to help me process errors that I would receive.
Each error was due to my mistakes in code, mostly in the API section, like a file missing or a letter needing to be lowercase when I had typed it out upper.
The AI was extremely helpful in the implementation of RESTful architecture, as I had never worked with it before.
